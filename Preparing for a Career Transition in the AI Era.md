### 2. Networking and Mentorship

If you're looking to transition into a different role, networking will be essential. Here's how to get started:

- **Join Industry Communities**: Participate in online forums, LinkedIn groups, or professional communities in your field of interest, such as product management, AI in industrial settings, or automation. Engaging in these groups can help you connect with professionals and learn about potential opportunities.
  
- **Seek Mentors**: Identify mentors within your company or industry who have the kind of roles you aspire to. Ask them how they navigated their own career transitions, and learn from their insights and experiences.

- **Attend Conferences and Webinars**: Whether virtual or in-person, attend events where industry experts gather. This will keep you informed on new trends and give you the chance to meet people who can offer advice or even career opportunities.

- Take on new responsibilities in your current role that match your future goals (e.g., managing a project, leading a small team, or learning about automation systems).
- Update your resume and LinkedIn to reflect your newly acquired skills and the direction you're moving in.

#### **Long-Term Goals (12-24 Months):**
