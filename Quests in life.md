I like how these three paths complement each other:  

- **Growth** keeps you moving forward  
- **Balance** keeps you stable  
- **Happiness** gives meaning to both  

Just like in a game, progress in one path often unlocks achievements in others. For example:  

- Better **balance** (like good rest) helps you grow faster  
- **Growth** often leads to moments of happiness  
- **Happiness** gives you energy for maintaining balance
